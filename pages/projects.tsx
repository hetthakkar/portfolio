            A cross platform multiplayer card game written in Flutter and
            available on both iOS and Android.
            <br />
            Kachuful is a traditional Indian card game with variants of it
            existing all across the world. It is best played with friends and
            family, however, with the pandemic, this was a little difficult. My
            cousin <a className='link' target="_blank" rel='noreferrer' href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/savanthakkar/">Savan</a> and I missed playing this game with the family, decided
            to make a virtual substitute while in quarantine. A lot of people
            resonated with the idea with the game gaining quite a bit of
            popularity with many feature requests positive feedback from the
            community pouring in. It is available for download{' '}
